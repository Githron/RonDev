    <!-- JavaScript for loop explained


    
        Explain this pls for (let i = 0; i < destinations.length; i++) 
    
        The code you provided is written in JavaScript and is
        using a for loop to iterate through an array called destinations. Here is a breakdown of what is happening in
        this line of code: for keyword is used to start a loop that will iterate through the array. let i=0 initializes
        a variable called i to zero, which will be used as the loop counter. i < destinations.length sets a condition
        for the loop to continue as long as the value of i is less than the length of the destinations array. i++ is
        shorthand for incrementing the value of i by 1 after each iteration of the loop. This ensures that the loop will
        eventually exit and not run infinitely. So in summary, this line of code initializes a loop that will iterate
        through the destinations array, starting at the first element and continuing until the last element has been
        reached. During each iteration of the loop, the value of i will be incremented by 1, allowing the loop to move
        on to the next element in the array.  -->
